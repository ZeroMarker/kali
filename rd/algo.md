## Preface

This book evolved over the past ten years from a set of lecture notes developed while teaching the undergraduate
Algorithm course at Berkeley and U.C. San Diego. Our way of teaching this course evolved tremendously over these
years in a number of directions, partly to address out students' background (undeveloped formal skills outside of
programming), and partly to reflect the maturing of the field in general, as we have come to see it. The notes 
increasingly crystallized into a narrative, and we progressively structured the course to emphasize the "story 
line" implicit in the progression of the material. As a result, the topics were carefully selected and clustered. 
No attempt was made to be encyclopedic, and this freed us to include topics traditionally de-emphasized or ommitted 
from most Algorithms books.

	本书由过去十多年的在伯克利大学和圣地亚哥大学本科算法课程教学笔记结集而成。
